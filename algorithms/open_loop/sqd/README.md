# Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization

This package provides implementation for the QCSC algorithm demonstrated in the paper [Chemistry Beyond the Scale of Exact Diagonalization on a Quantum-Centric Supercomputer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05068).

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before starting, make sure:

- For `quantum_source = "real-device"`, you have IBM Quantum credentials for QRMI. See the
  [QRMI Sampler guide](../../../docs/howto/howto_qrmi_slurm_sampler.md).
- You have completed [How to Set Up the MDX Workflow Server for QCSC Execution](../../../docs/howto/howto_setup_mdx_server.md).
- You have built the DICE executable under `packages/qcsc-prefect-dice/native` and know its absolute path.

From the repository root, install the local qcsc-prefect packages and the SQD workflow:

```bash
cd /path/to/qcsc-prefect

uv pip install --no-deps \
  -e packages/qcsc-prefect-core \
  -e packages/qcsc-prefect-adapters \
  -e packages/qcsc-prefect-blocks \
  -e packages/qcsc-prefect-executor \
  -e packages/qcsc-prefect-dice \
  -e packages/qcsc-prefect-qiskit

uv pip install -e algorithms/qcsc_workflow_utility
uv pip install -e algorithms/open_loop/sqd
```

After installation, you can deploy the workflow in a Prefect server:

```bash
sqd-deploy
```

In the Prefect UI, the flow parameters now include:

- `quantum_source`: choose `real-device` or `random`
- `random_seed`: base seed used when `quantum_source = "random"`
- `runner_name`: defaults to the `QrmiRuntimeBlock` `qrmi-runtime`

Set `quantum_source = "random"` when you want to skip quantum sampling and use deterministic pseudo-random bitstrings instead.

Before running on Miyabi or Fugaku, create the DICE-related blocks, the
`sampler_options` variable and, for `quantum_source = "real-device"`, the
`QrmiRuntimeBlock`. Start by copying the example config:

```bash
cp algorithms/open_loop/sqd/sqd_blocks.example.toml algorithms/open_loop/sqd/sqd_blocks.toml
```

The `[runtime]` and `[runtime.qrmi]` tables at the end of the file describe the
`QrmiRuntimeBlock`:

- For `quantum_source = "random"` only, delete both tables. No QRMI settings or API key
  are needed, and an existing runtime block is left unchanged.
- For `quantum_source = "real-device"` with `scheduler = "iqp"`, set `resource` and the
  `[runtime.qrmi]` values, and put the API key in the environment. It must not be
  written in the file. See [Quantum sampling](#quantum-sampling) for the details and for
  `scheduler = "slurm"`.

Then create the blocks:

```bash
export QRMI_IBM_QCS_IAM_APIKEY="<your API key>"  # only with a [runtime] table for IQP
python algorithms/open_loop/sqd/create_blocks.py --config algorithms/open_loop/sqd/sqd_blocks.toml --hpc-target miyabi
```

For Fugaku, start from `algorithms/open_loop/sqd/sqd_blocks.fugaku.example.toml` and pass
`--hpc-target fugaku` instead. Its `[runtime]` tables are commented out, so it works
for random mode as copied; uncomment them for `quantum_source = "real-device"`.

For a Fugaku build, use `packages/qcsc-prefect-dice/native/build_dice_fugaku.sh`
as the starting point and make sure the same runtime libraries are reflected in
`fugaku_spack_modules`, `modules`, or `environments` in the TOML when needed.

Set `dice_executable` in the TOML file to the built binary, for example:

```toml
dice_executable = "/path/to/qcsc-prefect/packages/qcsc-prefect-dice/native/bin/Dice"
```

On Fugaku, `work_dir` and `dice_executable` should point to a shared path that
compute nodes can read, for example a `/vol...` location.

See the [Run Hybrid Workflow](../../../docs/tutorials/run_sqd_workflow.md) tutorial for the end-to-end steps.

## Quantum sampling

```text
Quantum sampling
├─ real-device → QrmiRuntime
│                ├─ scheduler="iqp"
│                │    └─ QRMI → IQP (without Slurm)
│                └─ scheduler="slurm"
│                     └─ Slurm → QRMI → QPU
└─ random      → Existing local random sampling
```

The block's `scheduler` selects `iqp` or `slurm`; they are runtime settings within
`real-device`. This algorithm has no `qfw` source; the QFw-SLURM path is only in
[`closed_loop/sqd_de`](../../closed_loop/sqd_de/README.md).

With `quantum_source = "real-device"`, the flow loads the `QrmiRuntimeBlock` named by
`runner_name` and sends the LUCJ circuit untranspiled in one `sampler()` call. With
`quantum_source = "random"`, it returns pseudo-random bitstrings before any circuit is
built.

The ffsim pre-init stage runs in the workflow process (the runtime's `prepare` hook).
The runtime then transpiles the circuit against the actual Target with the SQD hook
`sqd_dice.transpilation:transpile`, using the optimization level and SABRE settings in
the `circuit` parameters. The flow sets these hooks and their configuration, so the
block's `transpiler` and `transpile_config` are not used. Where the hook runs depends on
the block's scheduler:

- `scheduler = "iqp"`: in the workflow process. Install QRMI there
  (`pip install "qrmi[ibm]"`; wheels are published for Linux, other platforms build
  from source with a Rust toolchain). The process must reach IBM Quantum.
- `scheduler = "slurm"`: on the compute node. Install this package (`algorithms/open_loop/sqd`)
  in the compute-node Python as well, so that the hook can be imported.

With `scheduler = "iqp"`, jobs are not grouped in a session or batch: each
`sampler()` call is one IQP job. If a submission result is unknown, for example after a
network error, the job is not resubmitted; check the IBM Quantum dashboard using the
resource and time in the log before running again. See
[How to Set Up a QRMI Runtime Block for Direct IQP Execution](../../../docs/howto/howto_setup_qrmi_iqp_runtime.md)
to create the block.

`create_blocks.py` creates the block from the `[runtime]` table of the TOML file, as
shown in [Getting Started](#-getting-started). Other keys of the table are
`QrmiRuntimeBlock` fields. For IQP, `[runtime.qrmi]` holds QRMI's settings without the
`<resource>_` prefix, and `QRMI_IBM_QCS_IAM_APIKEY` is read from the environment. The
block stores the API key as a secret. For Slurm, set `scheduler = "slurm"`, `root_dir`
and the three block names described in the
[QRMI Sampler guide](../../../docs/howto/howto_qrmi_slurm_sampler.md), and leave out
`[runtime.qrmi]`; no API key is read.

## Solver selection

The flow uses DICE by default (`DiceSHCISolverJob` named by `solver_name`). To use SBD,
set `solver_block_ref` to `sbd_solver_job/<name>`; `dice_shci_solver_job/<name>` selects
DICE explicitly. The slug selects the block class, and an unknown slug is rejected.

DICE and SBD take the same arguments but do not solve the same problem. SBD:

- solves closed-shell systems only, and uses one determinant set for alpha and beta;
- needs the Hartree-Fock determinant first;
- has no total spin target, so `spin_sq` must be `null` in the molecule settings.

Input that SBD cannot solve fails with `ValueError` before sampling. For SBD, the flow
puts the Hartree-Fock determinant first and keeps the subspace size limit: one slot for
Hartree-Fock and `int(sqrt(subspace_dim)) - 1` others. The subspace therefore always
includes Hartree-Fock and is not the same as the one DICE gets for the same settings.
DICE settings, including the default `spin_sq = 0.0`, are unchanged.

[`default_params/n2_sbd.json`](./default_params/n2_sbd.json) is an N2 example for SBD with
`spin_sq = null` and random sampling.

## 🧭 MPI Parameter Tuning

The [perf](./perf/) module also includes example code for implementing a meta workflow.
This workflow internally runs SQD workflows with different flow parameters, and measures the weak and strong scaling of the DICE solver.

## 🧑‍💻 Contribution Guidelines

This package is a reference implementation of the SQD experiment described in the publication.
It is considered feature-complete and is now in maintenance mode.

Further contributions are limited to bug fixes and improvements to Prefect usage patterns.
Workflow developers may use this as a testbed for workflow technology research.
